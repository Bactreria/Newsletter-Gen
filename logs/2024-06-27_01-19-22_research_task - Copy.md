- Title: **Anthropic Releases ‘Most Intelligent’ AI Model in Rivalry With OpenAI**
- **Summary:** Anthropic, a rival to OpenAI, announced that it has made its own AI advance that will upgrade chatbots and other use cases. The new model, called Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is an upgrade to its existing Claude 3 family of AI models. It is more adept at solving math, coding, and logic problems as measured by commonly used benchmarks. Anthropic says it is also a lot faster, better understands nuances in language, and even has a better sense of humor.

- Title: **We’re Still Waiting for the Next Big Leap in AI**
- **Summary:** While the new model is the world’s best by some measures, it’s more of a step forward than a big leap. Anthropic’s new model, called Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is an upgrade to its existing Claude 3 family of AI models. It is more adept at solving math, coding, and logic problems as measured by commonly used benchmarks. Anthropic says it is also a lot faster, better understands nuances in language, and even has a better sense of humor. But the company’s news is also a reminder that the world is still waiting for another AI leap forward in AI akin to that delivered by GPT-4.

- **Summary:** SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son has claimed that artificial super intelligence (ASI) could be a reality within the next decade. Speaking at SoftBank’s annual meeting in Tokyo on June 21, Son painted a picture of a future where AI far surpasses human intelligence, potentially revolutionising life as we know it. Son asserted that by 2030, AI could be “one to 10 times smarter than humans,” and by 2035, it might reach a staggering “10,000 times smarter” than human intelligence.

- Title: **Emergence thinks it can crack the AI agent code**
- **Summary:** Emergence, whose co-founders include Satya Nitta, the former head of global AI solutions at IBM’s research division, on Monday emerged from stealth with $97.2 million in funding from Learn Capital plus credit lines totaling more than $100 million. Emergence claims to be building an “agent-based” system that can perform many of the tasks typically handled by knowledge workers, in part by routing these tasks to first- and third-party generative AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o.

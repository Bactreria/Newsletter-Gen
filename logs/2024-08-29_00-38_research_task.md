- Title: **Hungry for Clean Energy, Facebook Looks to a New Type of Geothermal**
- Summary: Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has partnered with Sage Geosystems to develop up to 150 megawatts of geothermal energy to power its data centers. Sage will use fracking techniques to create fractures underground and pump water into them, heating the water to generate electricity without greenhouse gas emissions.

Story 2:
- Title: **Scientists propose guidelines for solar geoengineering research**
- Summary: An international team of scientists has published a paper with specific recommendations for evaluating proposals to inject sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to reflect heat from the Sun and offset Earth's warming temperatures. The paper also suggests criteria for discontinuing those scenarios that are not feasible because of scientific, technical, or societal issues.

Story 6:
- Title: **Revealed: US airlines lobbied EU over its plan to monitor plane emissions**
- Summary: US airlines lobbied against plans to monitor the climate impact of non-CO2 emissions from planes, arguing that there is uncertainty in the science and that the rules could influence pricing. This lobbying effort has been criticized for trying to avoid accountability for the extra climate warming caused by long-haul flights.

Story 7:
- Title: **Job title of the future: Weather maker**
- Summary: Cloud seeding, a technique used to increase snowfall by injecting silver iodide dust into clouds, is gaining global interest as a way to address water scarcity and climate change. The practice is becoming more common as a way to increase rainfall and snowpack, prevent hailstorms, and reduce air pollution.

- Title: **This Nvidia partner says it can cut data center energy use by 50% as AI boom strains power grid**
- Summary: Sustainable Metal Cloud, a data center company, is using immersion cooling technology to reduce energy consumption by up to 50% in its "sustainable AI factories." The company's HyperCubes contain servers fitted with Nvidia processors that are submerged in a synthetic oil, drawing heat away more efficiently than air cooling.

Story 9:
- Title: **Canada’s Wildfires Were a Top Global Emitter Last Year, Study Says**
- Summary: Wildfires that ravaged Canada’s boreal forests in 2023 produced more planet-warming carbon emissions than the burning of fossil fuels in all but three countries, according to a study published in Nature. The wildfires raise concerns about the ability of these forests to store carbon in the future, potentially impacting calculations of how much more greenhouse gas humans can add to the atmosphere without exceeding global warming targets.
